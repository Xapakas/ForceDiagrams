    <h1>Datasets That Can Be Represented With a Force Diagram</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><b>A dataset containing countries and their neighbors.</b> In this case, nodes could be countries, and edges would exist between countries that border one another. Countries could even be color-coded by continent for extra effect.</li>
      <li><b>A dataset containing colleges and the other colleges their applicants most often applied to.</b> Nodes could be colleges, and the "strength" of an edge would be based upon what percentage of the original college's applicants also applied to the other college.</li>
      <li><b>A dataset concerning celebrity relationships.</b> Nodes could be celebrities who have been in multiple relationships with other celebrities. Edges would imply some relationship, and could be color coded to indicate "married", "dating", "broken up", etc.</li>
